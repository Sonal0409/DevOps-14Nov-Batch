Hi Sonal Ma'am,

Hope you're doing good and learners are enjoyig.
**Sorry to barge in to this branch.

I've received a call back from Infosys Talent Acquisition team, regarding a devops role and has been scheduled for an Interview on Saturday. (26th Nov).

** Role- Systems Engineer - DevOps (1-2 years) Hyderabad-Azure, AWS DevOps

I'm preparing for the same, doing lots of research online also going through lectures from Edureka and interview questions.

But I'm really nervous & getting fear thinking about technical round- if I can answer to match standard. This will be my first DevOps interview; my prior experiences are in non-technical domain and really not much exposure to real time devops projects in Industry.

-- I know you'll be occupied with your personal tasks and lectures aligned but it'd be a great help to me if I can get your <15-20 Mins > of your free time on Friday (25th Nov), So that I can make mistakes on Friday to avoid it on Saturday & rectify early before an opportunity slips out.

I'd really appreciate if you can help me prepare through a mock interview during that 20 mins time and guide me understand what areas I should prepare more to be best at the Interview.

I'm very much flexible to match up to your precious time on Friday. Meanwhile I'll prepare my best.

Regards,
Swastik.

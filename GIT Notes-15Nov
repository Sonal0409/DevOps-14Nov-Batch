git log

git log --oneline


Assignment:

Save the git log in a file

Demo 7:
******************

Show us the changes in the file that are new and the changes that have been commited

git diff index1.html

All the chnages that are not commited needs to be discarded

My changes are in WD

git restore index1.html ==> to discard changes in working directory

OR

git checkout -- index1.html

Show us the changes in the file that are staged

git diff --staged

All the chnages that are not commited needs to be moved back to WD (red color)

"git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage


See what chnages were commited

git show commtid

We want to revert the file back to its previous state

Revert command in git:
***************

Revert command works on a single commit
What ever chnages happend in the commit will be back to previous state
Also when you revert because the file state changes --> a commit id will be automatically generated
Revert message shoudl also be added

As the revert command on a commit is executed
An editor will open ==> message
==> save it 

git revert <commit id>

Delete a file in git repository and WD
*******************************************

git rm index1.html

git commit -m "deleted file"
